        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

"Content:\n"
"1.	Adding Ingredients, Origins or Categories\n"
"2.	Adding recipes\n"
"3.	Modify Recipe\n"
"4.	Search Engine\n\n"

"1. Adding Ingredients, Origins or Categories:\n"
 	"To add any of the items above to the application, the user has to navigate to the corresponding list of said element and click on the “+” button located at the bottom right of the screen.  This action will open an Add page. The user enters the name of origin, category or ingredient, whichever is applicable, then clicks on \"Save\" button and the new element will appear in the related list. \n\n"

"Important:\n"
"-	To remove any of these three, swipe left the item desired to be deleted in the list page, however the item will be permanently deleted. \n"
"-	Users cannot enter two origins, categories or ingredients in the same list. \n"
"-	Ingredients cannot have spaces in them. Spaces will be substituted with a \"-\".\n\n"

"2. Adding recipes:\n"
"To add a recipe to the system, the user clicks the “+” button at the bottom-right of the recipes list and the add recipe page will open."
"In the add page, the user indicates the name of the recipe. All the ingredients in the recipe must be selected by clicking the \"Add Ingredients\" button, followed by the selection of all the ingredients used in the recipe. The user has to select the category and the origin related to the recipe by clicking on the respective text box, a list will appear and the user has to click the related origin and related category."
"Preparation and cooking times can be manually set, but are optional and will fixed at zero by default. \n\n"

"Important:\n"
"-	Any new ingredients, category or origin has to be added into the system before the recipe itself by using the respective add pages otherwise, they will not appear.\n"    
"-	To remove a recipe, swipe left the element in the recipe list, however the item will be permanently deleted.\n\n"   

"3. Modify Recipe:\n"
"To modify a recipe, the user has to click on the desired recipe in the recipe list and click on the pencil button in the top-right of the recipe page. The modification page will then open and from this page the user can modify anything in the recipe. The name of the recipe, preparation time, cookingt time and steps can be modified directly from the text box. To remove an ingredient, you must click on the ingredient to be removed from the list. To add an ingredient, click on the \"Add Ingredients\" button and select the ingredients that you want to add. The category and origin can be modified by clicking on the text box and selecting the element that you want.\n\n"

"Important:\n"
"- To succesfully modify a recipe, you must have at least one ingredient and a name.\n\n"

"4. Search Engine:\n"

"CookHelper’s search engine refers to the ingredients desired and not desired in the recipe, as well as the category and the origin of the meal. However, the syntax has to be written correctly in the "search text field for the search to execute. Here are the rules for the syntax of the statement: \n"
"1.	When an ingredient is mandatory in the recipe the syntax form is:\n AND \"Ingredient\". \n"
"2.	When an ingredient is not desired in the recipe the syntax form is:\n NOT \"Ingredient\".\n"
"3.	When an ingredient is optional in the recipe the syntax form is:\n OR \"Ingredient\".\n"
"4.	Between every element, a space is required.\n"
"Exemple:"
"-	AND Milk NOT Egg OR Sugar"
"-	OR Tomato NOT Sugar OR Bread NOT Salt NOT Pepper AND Water\n"
"Important:"
"-	The user has to choose a category and an origin to operate the search or the first category and the first origin in both lists will be selected."
"-	The search is not caps sensitive."
"-	Order of statement does not matter."
